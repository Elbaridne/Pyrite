# Pyrite - Telegram bot built in Python
By Mario (Elbaridne) mariomblu.com

### Features:
* ### Reddit Fetching
* Image, GIF, Video without taking up space in your phone! 
* Spongebob Mock meme
* MP3 link scraping 





### Set up:
First of all, you need to create a few files in bot base directory with the following format:
> redditauth
```sh
secret your-secret-api-code
api user pass your-account-password
api user your-account-username
client id your-client-id
user agent your-user-agent-name
```

> config
```sh
your-telegram-api-key
your-own-telegram-id (you can find it with a Telegram bot, not used right now but neccesary)
```

And to get the server up and running, use:
```sh
sudo -s nohup python3
```

You also need the proper url to scrap the mp3 in mp3_scraper (hint: datmusic)
